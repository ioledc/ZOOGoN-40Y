Description: Standardizes taxonomic names in zooplankton datasets from the LTER-MareChiara 
    station in the Gulf of Naples (1984-2024). This package is part of the DTO-BioFlow 
    project (Digital Twin Ocean - Biodiversity Flow Integration) under the EU Horizon 
    Mission to restore ocean and waters by 2030. It processes 40 years of Mediterranean 
    zooplankton monitoring data, extracting standardized genus-species information and 
    converting datasets to Darwin Core Archive format for integration with EMODnet Biology 
    and the European Digital Twin of the Ocean.
