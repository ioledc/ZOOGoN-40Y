\title{Extract standardized genus-species names from taxonomic strings}
\usage{
extract_genus_species(taxa_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa_vector}{A character vector of taxonomic names.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{original_name}{The original taxonomic string.}
\item{genus_species}{The extracted or standardized genus-species name.}
}
}
\description{
This function parses a vector of taxonomic names and attempts to extract or
standardize genus-species level information. It handles various cases such as
species complexes (e.g., with \code{+}), family-level entries with \code{n.i.}, higher
groups with dashes, and standard binomial names (with or without subgenus and
author information). If no rule applies, the original name is retained.
