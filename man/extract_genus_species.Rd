\title{Extract standardized genus-species names from taxonomic strings}
\usage{
extract_genus_species(taxa_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxa_vector}{A character vector of taxonomic names from zooplankton samples.
Typically from the TAXA column of LTER-MareChiara dataset.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{original_name}{The original taxonomic string as provided.}
\item{genus_species}{The extracted or standardized genus-species name
suitable for Darwin Core scientificName field.}
}
}
\description{
This function parses a vector of taxonomic names from the LTER-MareChiara
zooplankton dataset and attempts to extract or standardize genus-species level
information for Darwin Core compliance. It handles various cases commonly found
in Mediterranean zooplankton taxonomy including species complexes, family-level
entries, higher taxonomic groups, and standard binomial names with author citations.
}
\details{
The standardization follows these rules:
\itemize{
\item Species complexes (e.g., "Genus1+Genus2") become "Genus1 spp"
\item Family-level entries (e.g., "Familidae n.i.") become "Familgenus sp"
\item Higher groups with dashes (e.g., "Genus - group") become "Genus indet"
\item Standard binomials with authors are cleaned to "Genus species" format
\item Subgenus information in parentheses is removed
\item Unmatched entries retain their original form
}
}

# Examples from Gulf of Naples zooplankton samples
taxa_examples <- c(
  "Sardinella+Sardinops",                    # Species complex
  "Clupeidae n.i.",                          # Family level identification  
  "Engraulis - group",                       # Higher taxonomic group
  "Lutjanus (Paradies) argentimaculatus (Forsskål, 1775)",  # With subgenus & author
  "Chiridius poppei Giesbrecht, 1893",       # Standard binomial with author
  "Larvae n.i."                              # Developmental stage entry
)

# Expected output:

# "Sardinella+Sardinops"                                 "Sardinella spp"

# "Chiridius poppei Giesbrecht, 1893"                    "Chiridius poppei"
# "Larvae n.i."                                          "Larvae n.i."
